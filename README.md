# Swiggy
Complete frontend Project

Skills-
JavaScript, React, Redux, Firebase

Features-
Used react to create fontend foodapplication with data of SWIGGY from Bangalore location India. Live data is being fetched from bangalore location swiggy api. Designed cards, menu, shimmer UI, login page etc.... 
live data is fetched in JSON format from Swiggy application but since the the format to store this data changes frequently by the swiggy developer team, if this application does not work or if it breaks then we need to checn data storing format of swiggy and do the nessesary changes in the fetching logic.
Used redux store and hooks like UseState, UseEffect and custom hooks.
